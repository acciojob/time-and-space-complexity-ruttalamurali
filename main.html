      <h1>Time Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a type of computational complexity that describes the time required to execute an algorithm. It is more efficient and it is amount of time it takes for each statement to complete.</p>

	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is a parallel concept to time complexity. If we need to create an array of size n, this will require O(n) space. If we create a two-dimensional array of size n*n, this will require O(n2) space. In recursive calls stack space also counts.</p>
